Here's a breakdown of the interview questions and your answers, focusing on what you did well and areas for improvement:

Question 1:  Optimizing Performance for Slow Connections

 Your Answer:  You correctly acknowledged that CSS frameworks are one part of the equation, but you didn't delve into the specifics of performance optimization for slow connections.  
 Areas for Improvement:
     Code Optimization:  You should have mentioned techniques like:
         Minification:  Reducing the size of JavaScript and CSS files.
         Lazy Loading:  Loading components or resources only when they are needed (e.g., images below the fold).
         Code Splitting:  Dividing your code into smaller bundles to reduce initial load times.
     Image Optimization:  Discuss techniques like:
         Compression:  Using tools like WebP to reduce file size without losing quality.
         Responsive Images:  Serving different image sizes based on the device and screen size.
     Caching Strategies:  Explain how to leverage browser caching:
         Cache Control Headers:  Telling the browser how long to cache resources.
         Service Workers:  Using them for offline caching and pre-fetching resources.

Question 2:  Code Optimization in JavaScript

 Your Answer: You discussed reusing components and conditional rendering, which are excellent for code maintainability but not the core of code optimization for performance.
 Areas for Improvement:
     Minimize DOM Manipulation: Explain that excessive DOM manipulation (adding, removing, or changing elements) can impact performance. Suggest using techniques like virtual DOM (React's approach) to minimize these operations.
     Reduce Unnecessary Operations:  Discuss avoiding redundant calculations and unnecessary loops. 
     Asynchronous Operations:  Explain how to use asynchronous operations like `Promise` or `async/await` to prevent blocking the main thread while waiting for long-running tasks (like network requests).

Question 3:  State vs. Context in React

 Your Answer: You recognized that state and context have different use cases, but your explanation was a bit general. 
 Areas for Improvement:
     Scope:  Emphasize that `useState` is for managing state within a single component, while `useContext` allows sharing data across multiple components in a hierarchy.
     Performance:  While you mentioned that `useContext` can be slightly heavier, you didn't elaborate on why. Explain that `useContext` involves a global lookup, which can be more computationally expensive than accessing local state.

Overall Feedback:

 Solid Understanding:  You showed a good understanding of some key concepts, particularly component reusability and conditional rendering.
 Need More Depth:  The interview revealed a lack of deep knowledge in specific optimization techniques and the nuances of state management in React. 
 Practice is Key:  To improve, practice explaining your solutions in a clear and structured way.  Research and understand the specifics of techniques like minification, image optimization, and asynchronous operations.

Next Steps:

 Deepen Your Knowledge:  Focus on learning more about JavaScript performance optimization and React's state management system.
 Practice Explanations:  Try explaining these concepts to others or simulating interview situations.
 Build Projects:  Work on projects that require performance optimizations and explore different ways to manage state in React.
